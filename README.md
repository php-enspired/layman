layman
======

Augmented PDO features and query building tools.

dependencies
------------

Requires:
- php 7.3 or later
- Exceptable 2.0 or later (`composer require php-enspired/exceptable`)

installation
------------

_layman_ is currently **unreleased**. It is **NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE**.

Until it's ready, you'll have to clone it and manually `composer install` if you want to play around with it. Note; you should not expect things to work at present, but if you see anything that seems to be a bug, please let me know.

_layman_ is starting with Mysql support. Once a good foundation is developed, I'll look at support for other RDBMS's. Contributions will be welcome!
